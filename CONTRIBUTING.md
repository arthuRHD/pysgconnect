### Participate in Reviews

A good review will always help us to improve the quality of our deliverables.
Reviews are mainly for a feedback which will help the developers to get a different perception.
To have an effective review, please raise a PR with small amount of changes. If you have a large amount of changes, the review will be more painful and less effective.
